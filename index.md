# Matt Bitters, PhD

![matt-bitters-headshot](/img/Matthew-Bitters.jpg)

Hello and welcome to my page! I am the Fire Risk & Forest Resilience Project Manager at Earth Lab and the University of Colorado Boulder. I manage diverse research projects related to wildfire, disturbance, and ecosystem resilience at large spatial scales using remote sensing and big data. Prior to joining Earth Lab, I was a restoration ecologist at The Watershed Center, a Boulder County-based nonprofit watershed restoration organization that worked to restore local forests, grasslands, rivers, and riparian areas. In graduate school, I researched how habitat fragmentation and wildfire altered species distributions across Australian montane forests. I hold a PhD and BA in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from the University of Colorado Boulder.

In my free time, I enjoy putting my restoration ecology experience to practice by pulling weeds and planting native plants around my mountain home. I also enjoys trail running, biking, and skiing with my partner, Joan, and goldendoodle puppy, Puddle.

## Map activity
Nederland is a little paradise in Boulder County, Colorado, that I call home! One of my favorite places that I like to go to is the post office because everyone knows everyone!

## Climate change assignment
### [Australia is heating up! Temperatures have increased by 1.56°C since 1939!](https://matthewbitters.github.io/portfolio_posts/06_climate_canberra.html)

I did my PhD research in Australia, mainly based out of Canberra, the capital city. Summers were hot! Average maximum temperatures have increased by 1.56°C from 18.85°C in 1939 to 20.41°C in 2010. The predicted temperature average maximum temperature in 2050 is 21.29°C. I'm happy I won't have to trudge through the forests then!
