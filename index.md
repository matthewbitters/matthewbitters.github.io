# Matt Bitters, PhD

![matt-bitters-headshot](/img/Matthew-Bitters.jpg)

Hello and welcome to my page! I am the Fire Risk & Forest Resilience Project Manager at Earth Lab and the University of Colorado Boulder. I manage diverse research projects related to wildfire, disturbance, and ecosystem resilience at large spatial scales using remote sensing and big data. Prior to joining Earth Lab, I was a restoration ecologist at The Watershed Center, a Boulder County-based nonprofit watershed restoration organization that worked to restore local forests, grasslands, rivers, and riparian area. In graduate school, I researched how habitat fragmentation and wildfire altered species distributions across Australian montane forests. I hold a PhD and BA in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from the University of Colorado Boulder.

In my free time, I enjoy putting my restoration ecology experience to practice by pulling weeds and planting native plants around my mountain home. I also enjoys trail running, biking, and skiing with my partner, Joan, and goldendoodle puppy, Puddle.
